## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS custom properties to create variables:
```css
.className {
  --varColor: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
}
```

### Continued development

I'd like to keep focusing on CSS Flexbox because it was kind of difficult to order the share tab in the desktop design.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57408400/how-to-conditionally-apply-a-css-class/57408614#57408614) - This helped me for understend CSS properties. It's a short and clear answer.
- [Resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before) - This is an amazing blog which helped me to understand pseudo-element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning about CSS.
